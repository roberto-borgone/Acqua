# Acqua

### React Native mobile app for remote watering of my bonsai :)

I want to build a little Arduino system to remotely water my bonsai when i'm not at home. 
It will leverage of a moisture sensor, when the soil moisture falls down a given treshold Acqua will notify me giving me the opportunity
to command a water pump. 

#### Here's the app splash screen.
